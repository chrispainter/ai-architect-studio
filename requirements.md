# AI Real Estate App Requirements

## Concept
We want to build a modern real estate application that helps users find homes by having a natural conversation with an AI, rather than forcing them to use complicated search filters and dropdown maps. 

## Key Features
1. **Conversational Search:** A chat interface where a user can say "I need a 3 bedroom near a good elementary school with a big backyard for my dog."
2. **Dynamic AI Matching:** The system should take the chat and match it against property descriptions, generating a "Lifestyle Fit Score" for each house.
3. **Image Analysis:** The application should allow users to upload photos of kitchens or living rooms they like, and the AI should find active listings with similar visual styles.
4. **Responsive Design:** It needs to be beautiful and work flawlessly on both desktop web browsers and iOS/Android mobile devices.
5. **Secure Profiles:** The app needs to remember user preferences over time without leaking their personal data.
