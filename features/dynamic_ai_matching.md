# Feature: Dynamic AI Matching

## Description
This feature scores properties based on how well they match a user's conversational query. It generates a "Lifestyle Fit Score" by comparing the user's stated needs and preferences against the details of each property listing.

## Dependencies
- This feature relies on the parsed user intent from the **Conversational Search** feature.

## User Stories
- As a user, I want to see a "Lifestyle Fit Score" on each property listing so that I can quickly understand how well it matches my needs.
- As a user, I want the score to consider not just explicit criteria (like "3 bedrooms") but also implicit desires (like "a quiet street" or "a modern kitchen").
