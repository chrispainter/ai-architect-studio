# Feature: Dynamic AI Matching

## Description
The system will analyze the user's conversational input and compare it against the details of property listings. Based on this comparison, it will generate a "Lifestyle Fit Score" for each property, indicating how well it matches the user's stated and implied preferences.

## User Stories
- As a user, I want to see a "Lifestyle Fit Score" on each property listing so I can quickly gauge how well it matches my needs.
- As a user, I want the score to be based on how well the property's description and features align with my conversational search query.
- As a user, I want the system to understand nuanced requests like "a good place for my dog" and match it with properties that have "big backyards" or are "near parks".
