# Feature: Conversational Search

## Description
This feature allows users to find homes using a natural language chat interface instead of traditional search filters. The user should be able to state their needs in a conversational manner, and the system will interpret their request to find matching properties.

## User Stories
- As a user, I want to type "I'm looking for a house with at least 3 bedrooms and a large backyard" into a chat window so I can get relevant listings without using complex forms.
- As a user, I want to be able to specify my desired neighborhood by saying "near a good elementary school" or "in a quiet area" so that the system can understand my location preferences.
- As a user, I want the chat interface to be the primary way I interact with the search functionality of the application.
