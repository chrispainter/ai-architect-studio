# Feature: Image Analysis

## Description
This feature allows users to upload images of rooms they like (e.g., kitchens, living rooms) to find active property listings with a similar visual style. The AI should be able to analyze the uploaded image and match it with images from the property database.

## User Stories
- As a user, I want to be able to upload a photo of a kitchen I like so that the app can show me listings with similar kitchen styles.
- As a user, I want the image matching to focus on key stylistic elements like color palettes, materials (e.g., granite countertops, hardwood floors), and overall aesthetic (e.g., modern, rustic).
- As a user, I want to see a gallery of visually similar listings after I upload an image.
