# Feature: Secure Profiles

## Description
The application will provide users with secure, persistent profiles to store their preferences, search history, and personal information. The system must prioritize data privacy and security.

## User Stories
- As a user, I want to be able to create an account and log in so that my search history and preferences are saved for future sessions.
- As a user, I want my personal information (like name, email, and saved homes) to be stored securely and not shared without my consent.
- As a user, I want the application to remember my preferences (e.g., typical number of bedrooms, preferred locations) to make future searches faster and more relevant.
