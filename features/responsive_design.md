# Feature: Responsive Design

## Description
The application must provide a seamless and visually appealing user experience across all major devices, including desktop web browsers, iOS phones, and Android phones. The layout and functionality should adapt gracefully to different screen sizes and orientations.

## User Stories
- As a user, I want to be able to access all the app's features on my desktop computer with a large screen so that I can easily browse listings.
- As a user, I want to have a fully functional and easy-to-use experience on my mobile phone (iOS or Android) so that I can search for homes on the go.
- As a user, I expect the application to automatically adjust its layout whether I'm holding my phone in portrait or landscape mode.
